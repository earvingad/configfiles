#+TITLE: Doom Emacs Windows

It is possible, it is functional and it is 8-10 seconds faster than
Spacemacs in Windows. However, slower than in Linux (that is Windows fault).

* What you need
If you have limited permissions in Windows PC (e.g. admin privileges), you might
not be able to use Chocolatey/Scoop.
However, you can still use ~git-bash.exe~ portable version!.
  - Download [[https://git-scm.com/download/win][git]].
  - Download [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases][Ripgrep]] and [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/releases][fd]]. Make sure you download the =windows-gnu= version.
  - Of course, download [[http://ftp.wayne.edu/gnu/emacs/windows/][emacs]].
Extract the binaries from ~Ripgrep~ and ~fd~ to their respective folders and
place them where you want.
  - You should have one folder for ~Ripgrep~ and another for ~fd~.
Extract emacs and place it where you want.
It does not matter where they are, we will add them to the ~Path~ later (but keep them
safe and where you remember).

* Instructions
** Edit system environment variables
- Go to ~Control panel -> User Accounts -> Change my environment variables~.
  + ~New~ type ~HOME~ and set your ~C:\Users\USERNAME~ and ~OK~.
  + Select ~Path~, ~edit~ and add your ~C:\path\to\the\emacs\bin~ folder and ~OK~.
  + Select ~Path~, ~edit~ and add your ~C:\path\to\the\ripgrep~ folder and ~OK~.
  + Select ~Path~, ~edit~ and add your ~C:\path\to\the\fd~ folder and ~OK~.
  + Click ~Ok~.
- We still need to add ~C:\Users\USERNAME\.emacs.d\bin~. First download Doom
  files.
** Install Doom
- Open ~git-bash.exe~
- Type ~cd ~~
- Run: ~git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d~
- After the download is completed, type ~cd ~/.emacs.d/bin~ and run: ~./doom install~
- If everything is fine, Doom is now installed.
- Just in case run ~./doom sync~
- Go to ~Control panel -> User Accounts -> Change my environment variables~.
  - Select ~Path~, edit and add ~C:\Users\USERNAME\.emacs.d\bin~, click ~OK -> OK~.
- Now you can start emacs and will see the Doom dashboard!
** All the icons
By default All-the-icons will not be enabled in Windows.
- If all-the-icons is not intalled. Open emacs and ~M-x package-install RET all-the-icons RET~.
- ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~ select where to download the fonts and
  installed them (double click -> install).
- Restart emacs and there you go.
** From one PC to another
If one of your PCs has no internet connection or is under a firewall, you can:
- Copy your ~~/.doom.d ~/.emacs.d ripgrep fd emacs~ folders directly to the
  other PC (~~/.domm.d ~/.emacs.d~ go in ~C:\Users\USERNAME~)
- Edit the system environment variables accordingly.
- Copy and install the fonts you downloaded with ~all-the-icons~
- Open ~git-bash.exe~, ~cd ~/.emacs.d/bin~ and run: ~./doom sync~
- /et voilÃ !/.
** Emacs server
If you use emacs server, Doom will place the server file in
~C:\Users\USERNAME\.emacs.d\.local\cache\server~ folder.
- Go to ~Control panel -> User Accounts -> Change my environment variables~.
  + ~New~ type ~EMACS_SERVER_FILE~ and set the file path ~C:\Users\USERNAME\.emacs.d\.local\cache\server\server~.
  + Create a ~emacsclientw.exe~ shortcut with ~emacsclientw.exe -nc~ in target,
    run emacs server and emacsclientw will work.
